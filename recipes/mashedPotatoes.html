    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> These garlic mashed potatoes are rich and very tasty! .</p>
    <p>For a creamier texture, use heavy cream in place of the milk. These are also terrific topped with sesame seeds or green onions.</p>

   <h3>Ingrediants</h3>

   <ul>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Milk and Butter</li>
    <li>Garlic </li>
    <li>Seasonings</li>
    
   </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Adding the butter first to the hot potatoes allows you to use less milk/cream and keeps the potatoes creamier for longer.</li>
    <li>Cooking the potatoes with garlic allows the garlic flavor to permeate the potatoes and sweetens the garlicâ€™s flavor rather than using raw, harsh garlic at the end. You can use russet potatoes, but they will not be as creamy as they are starchier.
    </li>
    <li>Serve with any protein that has a gravy.
    </li>

    <li>Stir in some sour cream and chives to add extra creaminess and flavor!</li>
  
</ol>
